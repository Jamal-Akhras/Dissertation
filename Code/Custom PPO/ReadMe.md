* NumPy
* matplot lib

## How to run:

* To train the model run ppoTrain.py, the results used in the dissertation were obtained after 48 hours or 17000 timesteps of training

* to run the trained model run main.py, ensuring that the paths to the trained models are adjusted. The trained modles are made available in the file "Trained Model".
